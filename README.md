# Quantum-Convolutional-Model
This project integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning to build a hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for digit classification using the MNIST dataset. It leverages PennyLane for quantum circuit simulation and TensorFlow/Keras for training a classical neural network on quantum-processed features.
